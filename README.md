# Purpose
In this short code , I'll explain several ways to detect fake news using collected data from different articles. But the same techniques can be applied to different scenarios. For the coders and experts, I'll explain the Python code to load, clean, and analyze data. Then we will do some machine learning models to perform a classification task (fake or not).
I am also using different type of algorithm like :Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification and Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Tf-idf vectorizer diffrent type of data preprocessing tecnique,
Logistic Regression ,GradientBoostingClassifier,Decision Tree Accuracy almost : 0.998 that is vary nice and Model Testing With Manual
